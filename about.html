                    <p>The Business Café (TBC) offers a new concept to old habits. Most of us meet in coffee shops for business, support each other and share our vulnerabilities as well as the good things that we find that can help us in our business. All of us need company from time to time and the majority benefit from bite size chunks of technical assistance from others!</p>

                            <h3>Shameer – CEO and co-founder</h3>
                            <p>The Business Cafe is Shameer's brainchild, borne of a rainy day when the trains were cancelled and the majority of fettered passengers decamped to a local coffee shop. Whilst everyone improvised meetings and caught up with emails, no-one chatted, there was no sitting place in the local town. How wonderful, he thought, if everyone could have such a place to feel less lonely in business, even better if they could also gain new skills and support each other.</p>

                            <p>Similarly, Imran had seen the demise of the high street and recognised a need for such spaces to regenerate with new purpose to breathe life back into independent traders and the communal space. In a more transactional way, his vision was for an entrepreneur's shop, where business people could meet, network and trade as a result.</p>
